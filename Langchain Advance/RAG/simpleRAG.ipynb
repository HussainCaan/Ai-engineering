      "What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that enables machines and computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It helps systems learn from data, recognize patterns and make decisions to solve complex problems. It is used in healthcare, finance, e-commerce and transportation offering personalized recommendations and enabling self-driving cars.Core Concepts of AIAI is based on core concepts and technologies that enable machines to learn, reason and make decisions on their own. Let's see some of the concepts:1. Machine Learning (ML)Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning model uses algorithms to identify patterns within data and improve its performance over time without human intervention.2. Generative AIGenerative AI is designed to create new content whether it's text, images, music or video. Unlike traditional AI which typically focuses on analyzing and classifying data, it goes a step further by using patterns it has learned from large datasets to generate new original outputs. It \"creates\" rather than just \"recognizes.\"3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows machines to understand and interact with human language in a way that feels natural. It enables speech recognition systems like Siri or Alexa to interpret what we say and respond accordingly. It combines linguistics and computer science to help computers process, understand and generate human language allowing for tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis and real-time conversation.4. Expert SystemsExpert Systems are designed to simulate the decision-making ability of human experts. These systems use a set of predefined \"if-then\" rules and knowledge from specialists in specific fields to make informed decisions similar to how a medical professional would diagnose a disease. They are useful in areas where expert knowledge is important but not always easily accessible. Working of Artificial IntelligenceAI works by simulating intelligent behavior to perform tasks autonomously. The process involves several steps that help machines learn, make decisions and improve over time:Data Collection: AI systems rely on large sets of data which could include images, text or sensor readings. For example, teaching an AI to recognize cats, we collect a dataset of labeled cat images.Processing and Learning: It uses algorithms to analyze data and identify patterns. For example, it learns to recognize key features like a cat’s shape, ears or whiskers helping it understand the data.Model Training: The AI model is trained using the data, adjusting its internal settings to improve its predictions. With more data, the model becomes more accurate and better at recognizing new examples like unseen images of cats.Decision Making: Once trained, it can use what it has learned to make decisions. For example, it can find whether a new image contains a cat based on the patterns it learned during training.Feedback and Improvement: It can improve through feedback, especially in methods like reinforcement learning. In this case, the AI receives rewards or penalties, refining its ability to make better decisions over time.Types of Artificial IntelligenceAI can be classified into two main categories based on its capabilities and functionalities.1. Based on Capabilities:Narrow AI (Weak AI): This type of AI is designed to perform a specific task or a narrow set of tasks such as voice assistants or recommendation systems. It is good in one area like recommending products or recognizing speech but lacks general intelligence.General AI (Strong AI): It is a theoretical concept where AI can perform any intellectual task that a human can do. It shows human-like reasoning and understanding across multiple domains, making it capable of tackling a variety of tasks.Superintelligent AI: It is a hypothetical form of AI that would surpass human intelligence in all areas. It would be capable of performing tasks more efficiently and effectively than humans.2. Based on Functionalities:Reactive Machines: These AI systems only react to specific tasks without storing past experiences. They don’t learn from previous actions but respond in a set way. For example is a chess-playing AI that evaluates the board and makes a move based on the current position.Limited Memory: These AI systems can use past data to improve future decisions. Self-driving cars are a good example, as they use data from previous trips to navigate roads and avoid obstacles.Theory of Mind: The theory of mind is a theoretical type of AI that would be able to understand emotions, beliefs, intentions and other mental states. This would allow the AI to interact with humans in a more natural and empathetic manner.Self-Aware AI: It is a hypothetical form of AI that possesses consciousness and self-awareness. It would have an understanding of its own existence and could make decisions based on that awareness.AI ModelsAI models are programs that learn from data and make decisions or predictions based on what they've learned. These models help AI perform tasks by recognizing patterns in data similar to how humans learn from experience. Different models use various learning approaches depending on how they are trained. Let's see some of the common types of AI models:1. Supervised Learning ModelsIn Supervised learning, AI is trained on labeled data with clear input-output pairs, helping the system to learn the relationship between them.The model is adjusted during training to reduce the difference between its predictions and the correct outputs.It’s used for tasks like image classification, spam filtering and medical diagnosis where labeled datasets are available.2. Unsupervised Learning ModelsIn Unsupervised Learning models, AI works with unlabeled data and identifies patterns, trends or groupings without direct guidance.It is valuable when exploring hidden structures in complex datasets such as detecting fraud.This method helps in tasks like customer segmentation, data clustering and anomaly detection.3. Reinforcement Learning ModelsIn Reinforcement learning, AI learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.Over time, the model optimizes its decision-making process to maximize positive outcomes.It is used in robotics, gaming (e.g AlphaGo) and autonomous systems where actions lead to varying consequences and the AI learns through experience.Advantages of AIAI offers a range of benefits that improve productivity, decision-making and user experience across multiple sectors. Let's see some key advantages:Efficiency and Automation: AI automates repetitive tasks, smoothen workflows and reducing human errors. This helps us save time and concentrate on more strategic and innovative tasks.Improved Decision Making: AI's ability to process and analyze large datasets helps businesses and individuals make informed, data-driven decisions. This is beneficial in sectors like healthcare, finance and retail.Personalization: It helps personalize experiences by analyzing user preferences and customizing recommendations. This enhances user satisfaction, as seen in platforms like Netflix, Amazon and social media feeds.24/7 Availability: Unlike humans, AI can operate continuously without rest, making it ideal for round-the-clock tasks such as customer support, security monitoring and data collection.Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition: It is proficient at analyzing large volumes of data and identifying patterns that may be difficult for humans to recognize. This capability helps in areas like healthcare diagnostics, fraud detection and market analysis.Real-World Applications of AIArtificial Intelligence has many practical applications across various industries and domains including:Healthcare: AI helps in early diagnosis and treatment recommendations by analyzing medical data such as images and patient history, improving preventative care.Retail: It personalizes shopping experiences by recommending products based on user behavior. It also helps optimize inventory management and predict demand, ensuring efficient stock control and better customer satisfaction.Customer Service: AI-powered chatbots handle routine customer inquiries, provide support 24/7 and escalate more complex issues to human agents. This improves efficiency and reduces wait times, enhancing overall customer experience.Manufacturing: It improves production efficiency by predicting machine maintenance needs, preventing downtime and also enhances supply chain management by forecasting demand, optimizing operations and reducing waste.Finance: AI in finance detects fraud, analyzes market data and automates risk management. It also assists in personalized investment advice, helping individuals make smarter financial decisions.Challenges of AIDespite of having various advantages, it have some challenges which need to be resolved:Data Privacy and Security: AI systems require vast amounts of data which can raise concerns about data privacy and protection. Ensuring sensitive information is secure and maintaining user trust is a significant challenge.Bias and Fairness: They can inherit biases from the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Addressing these biases is important for ensuring AI systems make impartial decisions.Lack of Transparency: AI models, especially deep learning can often act as \"black boxes\" making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of transparency can be problematic in areas like healthcare or law enforcement.Job Displacement: It automates tasks traditionally performed by humans, concerns about job losses in certain sectors arise. Ensuring a smooth transition for workers and retraining them for new roles is essential.Ethical Concerns: The use of AI in sensitive areas like surveillance, autonomous weapons and decision-making raises ethical questions. Finding a balance between technological innovation and ethical accountability remains a continuous challenge in AI development.\n"

      "What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n",
      "• RAG is an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
      "• LLMs are things like GPT4, Gemini, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, etc.\n",
      "• So, to understand what RAG is, it first helps to recap what an LLM is (and \n",
      "what it isn’t)\n",
      "7\n",
      "What an LLM is\n",
      "• An LLM is a text completion machine – it predicts the next best words. \n",
      "• Given a partial string of text, it will produce the best string of text that should follow it.\n",
      "• “Best” here means 2 things:\n",
      "1. The most likely \n",
      "2. The most valuable\n",
      "What do we mean by most likely?\n",
      "• The “most likely” completion is learned by experiencing examples of real \n",
      "text.\n",
      "• During “pre-training”, the LLM is exposed to hundreds of millions of examples of real \n",
      "text, which it attempts to complete (like fill in the _GAP_) \n",
      "• When it is wrong, it is penalised, and its internal state is updated to reflect that\n",
      "• This continues until it is really good at predicting real text\n",
      "What do we mean by valuable?\n",
      "• The “most valuable” completion is learned by testing it with real people (human \n",
      "feedback ). \n",
      "• Pre-training teaches the LLM how to produce real text\n",
      "• But there is no explicit concept in this of the value of any text completion\n",
      "• Inaccurate, or irrelevant, or rude text will just as likely appear in the training data as the opposite\n",
      "• In the second phase of training, the LLM is exposed to the reactions of real people to what it is \n",
      "producing.\n",
      "• Similar to pre-training, when the reactions are negative, it is penalised, and its internal state is \n",
      "updated to reflect that\n",
      "• This continues until it is good enough at producing completions that people value.\n",
      "• Technically this is called Reinforcement learning from human feedback\n",
      "What an LLM isn’t\n",
      "• It is not a lifelong learner\n",
      "• Once training is finished, the internal state of the LLM never changes again\n",
      "• When using something like ChatGPT, it may appear to learn, in the sense that it can recall earlier \n",
      "instructions or reference earlier parts of the conversation\n",
      "• That is because each output it produces is the result of completing the text of the full \n",
      "conversation up to that point (ChatGPT is not an LLM, it is a system that operates around an LLM)\n",
      "• It is not infinite\n",
      "• The “window” of text that an LLM can use for completion is finite\n",
      "• It can be very long (up to a hundred pages or more these days), but there is a limit\n",
      "• It is not a search engine\n",
      "• An LLM can’t search for new information on the internet (though it can be linked to one, see \n",
      "above point about ChatGPT)\n",
      "So what is RAG?\n",
      "• RAG systems are specialised tools designed for LLMs to facilitate the \n",
      "process of gathering and using information.\n",
      "• We save our resources in a database (vector DB)\n",
      "• We Retrieve what’s relevant \n",
      "• We use this information to Augment the Generation of the answer \n",
      "• To start, we need to represent the content numerically as embeddings\n",
      "12\n",
      "Embedding our text\n",
      "• Embeddings are a way of turning words or sections of text into a numerical code (list \n",
      "of numbers).\n",
      "• These numerical codes capture the semantics of what the text describes: the \n",
      "relationships between the codes reflect the relationships between the words they \n",
      "represent.\n",
      "• Embeddings come from the statistical structure of language: words that hang out \n",
      "together, or in groups are likely to have similar meanings, or to describe things in the \n",
      "world that often occur together.\n",
      "• Embeddings provide a computer-friendly representation of language that preserves \n",
      "much of the meaning.\n",
      "• This allows computer algorithms to work with language: for example, finding which \n",
      "chunk of a document has the closest embedding to a query prompt gives the chunk \n",
      "with the most relevant information.\n",
      "What does this mean in reality? Using the Science of \n",
      "Teaching Resources\n",
      "• Each point corresponds to a chunk of text from a \n",
      "document from the https://scienceofteaching.site/  \n",
      "materials.\n",
      "• The different colours represent different topic areas.\n",
      "• The position of each point corresponds to its numerical \n",
      "code (reduced to 2 numbers here for visualisation)\n",
      "• Chunks that are closer together are more similar in \n",
      "meaning.\n",
      "14\n",
      "There are many considerations for a RAG model\n",
      "Split into the two key components: Retrieval and Generation\n",
      "Retrieval: Finding relevant information\n",
      "• It’s like going to a huge library and finding the most relevant books to answer the \n",
      "question\n",
      "Generation: How do we use the retrieved information for response\n",
      "• Like an expert scholar summarises the information in the books you have picked out\n",
      "15\n",
      "A step by step example of how RAG works in a chatbot\n",
      "• The user asks a question – “Hi, can you help me with a lesson plan to explain gravity to year 5” \n",
      "• The system needs to generate a query to match against the content in the embeddings \n",
      "• To do this it uses the LLM to generate text that conveys the meaning of what we want \n",
      "•  this can be done through being designed to chat and get the information.\n",
      "• or by inferring what is needed and picking between its tools. \n",
      "• The query is then converted to embedding vector – and the model finds the nearest points in the \n",
      "database to this vector (nearest “n” where n can change). \n",
      "• These points – the content – are then sent back for Generation (or just for reference).\n",
      "• So here it can return any lesson plan structures (if they are standardised and saved) and any \n",
      "useful text on gravity.\n",
      "• This text is then appended to the Prompt \n",
      "• And the LLM processes the answer.\n",
      "Next up – a move towards compound AI systems\n",
      "• RAG models are just one example of how by combining components, AI-Edtech tools can get \n",
      "increasingly powerful.\n",
      "• By paying careful attention to the design of the system, we can improve the quality and accuracy \n",
      "of AI.\n",
      "• Many education tasks – lesson planning; test development; marking – maybe better suited to \n",
      "multistep designs. \n",
      "• This is especially important in education where control and trust is needed.\n",
